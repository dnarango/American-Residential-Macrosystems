      <description>NSF Link An apparent, but untested result of changes to the urban landscape is the homogenization of cities, such that neighborhoods in very different parts of the country increasingly exhibit similar patterns in their road systems, residential lots, commercial sites, and aquatic areas; cities have now become more similar to each other than to the native ecosystems that they replaced. This research builds on the team&amp;rsquo;s prior NSF funded research on the ecological homogenization of the &amp;lsquo;American Residential Macrosystem (ARM)&amp;rsquo; and specifically investigates factors that contribute to stability and/or changes in the ARM.</description>

      <title>ECOLOGICAL HOMOGENIZATION OF URBAN AMERICA</title>

      <description>NSF Link Urban, suburban and exurban environments are important ecosystems and their extent is increasing in the U.S. The conversion of wild or managed ecosystems to urban ecosystems is resulting in ecosystem homogenization across cities, where neighborhoods in very different parts of the country have similar patterns of roads, residential lots, commercial areas and aquatic features. Funds are provided to test the hypothesis that this homogenization alters ecological structure and functions relevant to ecosystem carbon and nitrogen dynamics, with continental scale implications.</description>
