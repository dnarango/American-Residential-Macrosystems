Residential yards are influencedby individual homeowner preferences and actions, and these factors are hypothesized to converge yard structure across broad scales. We examined soil total C and total d13C, organic C and organic d13C, total N, and d15N in residential yards and corresponding reference ecosystems in six cities across the United States that span major climates and ecological biomes (Baltimore, Maryland; Boston, Massachusetts; Los Angeles, California; Miami, Florida; Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minnesota; and Phoenix, Arizona). Across the cities, we found soil C and N concentrations and soil d15N were less variable in residential yards compared to reference sites supporting the hypothesis that soil C, N, and d15N converge across these cities. Increases in organic soil C, soil N, and soil d15N across urban, suburban, and rural residential yards in several cities supported the hypothesis that soils responded similarly to altered resource inputs across cities, contributing to convergence of soil C and N in yards compared to natural systems. Soil C and N dynamics in residential yards showed evidence of increasing C and N inputs to urban soils or dampened decomposition rates over time that are influenced by climate and/or housing age across the cities. In the warmest cities (Los Angeles, Miami, Phoenix), greater organic soil C and higher soil d13C in yards compared to reference sites reflected the greater proportion of C4 plants in these yards. In the two warm arid cities (Los Angeles, Phoenix), total soil d13C increased and organic soil d13C decreased with increasing home age indicating greater inorganic C in the yards around newer homes. In general, soil organic C and d13C, soil N, and soil d15N increased with increasing home age suggesting increased soil C and N cycling rates and associated 12C and 14N losses over time control yard soil C and N dynamics. This study provides evidence that conversion of native reference ecosystems to residential areas results in convergence of soil C and N at a continental scale. The mechanisms underlying these effects are complex and vary spatially and temporally.","tags":["homogenization","Urban ecology","Natural abundance carbon stable isotopes","Natural abundance nitrogen stable isotopes","Ecological convergence","Nitrogen cycling","soil C cycling","soil N cycling","urban residential yards","residential yard management"],"title":"Urban soil carbon and nitrogen converge at a continental scale","type":"publication"},{"authors":["J.

The structure, diversity, and composition of yard floras are largely determined by personal choices and landscaping priorities at local scales, but it is unclear whether these relationships hold across broader geographical areas. We investigated the relationship between homeowners’ criteria for vegetation and yard management choices, ecosystem-service based traits, and yard plant diversity (i.e., taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional) in 145 yards distributed across 6 major cities in the U.S. Individual priorities for a set of ecosystem services were collected with closed-ended questions and reduced into four main principal components using factor analyses: natural, neat, showy and low cost. Across cities, priorities for neat yards were negatively related to overall and spontaneous species richness. Priorities for showy yards were positively related to yard aesthetics (based on showiness of flowers, fruits and leaves for component plants) and spontaneous species richness. Homeowners that preferred low-cost yards had a significantly higher proportion of exotics, and yards with significantly lower functional diversity (i.e., a composite measure for plant height, seed mass, and specific leaf area). The proportion of natives was not related to homeowners’ priorities for natural yards and phylogenetic diversity was only weakly and negatively related to priorities for showy yards. Our study corroborates previous research showing that homeowners’ landscaping priorities are only partially related to their yard vegetation at the continental scale. The disconnection might be attributed to broader institutional, structural, and ecological constraints that prevent people’s personal ideals and priorities from being realized","tags":["homogenization","Urban ecology","Domestic Gardens","Ecosystem Services","Human Values","Plant Diversity","Socio-ecological systems"],"title":"Linking yard plant diversity to homeowners’ landscaping priorities across the U.S","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Data List of datasets and associated metadata produced from this project\nEcological Homogenization of Urban America (2011-2016) Biophysical Data Soil chemistry\nMicroclimate\nSoil Microclimate - In progress\nPlant carbon and nitrogen\nSoil carbon and nitrogen\nBiodiversity Lawn plants - abundance\nLeaf Morphology - TBA\nPlant species - presence/absence\nPlant transects (reference sites only) - TBA\niTree Data - TBA\nSocial Data Phone Surveys\nInterviews - Quantitative\nInterview - Qualitative - Contact K.

We determined the ecological and socioeconomic factors that influence patterns of plant richness, phylogenetic diversity and composition in 133 private household yards in the Minneapolis‐Saint Paul Metropolitan area, Minnesota, USA. We compared the composition of spontaneously occurring plant species and those planted by homeowners with composition in natural areas (at the Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve) and in the horticulture pool of species available from commercial growers. Yard area and fertilizer frequency influenced species richness of the spontaneous species but expressed homeowner values did not. In contrast, the criteria that homeowners articulated as important in their management decisions—including aesthetics, wildlife, neatness and food provision—significantly predicted cultivated species richness. Strikingly, the composition of plant species that people cultivated in their yards resembled the taxonomic and phylogenetic composition of species available commercially. In contrast, the taxonomic and phylogenetic composition of spontaneous species showed high similarity to natural areas. The large fraction of introduced species that homeowners planted was a likely consequence of what was available for them to purchase. The study links the composition and diversity of yard flora to their natural and anthropogenic sources and sheds light on the human factors and values that influence the plant diversity in residential areas of a major urban system. Enhanced understanding of the influences of the sources of plants—both native and introduced—that enter urban systems and the human factors and values that influence their diversity is critical to identifying the levers to manage urban biodiversity and ecosystem services.","tags":["horticulture","urban domestic yards","introduced species","urban biodiversity","attitudes","preferences"],"title":"Horticultural availability and homeowner preferences drive plant diversity and composition in urban yards","type":"publication"},{"authors":["D.

Given that lawns are widespread across diverse climatic regions and there is rising concern about the environmental impacts associated with their management, there is a clear need to understand the geographic variation, drivers, and outcomes of common yard care practices. We hypothesized that 1) income, age, and the number of neighbors known by name will be positively associated with the odds of having irrigated, fertilized, or applied pesticides in the last year, 2) irrigation, fertilization, and pesticide application will vary quadratically with population density, with the highest odds in suburban areas, and 3) the odds of irrigating will vary by climate, but fertilization and pesticide application will not. We used multi-level models to systematically address nested spatial scales within and across six U.S. metropolitan areas—Boston, Baltimore, Miami, Minneapolis-St. Paul, Phoenix, and Los Angeles. We found significant variation in yard care practices at the household (the relationship with income was positive), urban-exurban gradient (the relationship with population density was an inverted U), and regional scales (city-to-city variation). A multi-level modeling framework was useful for discerning these scale-dependent outcomes because this approach controls for autocorrelation at multiple spatial scales. Our findings may guide policies or programs seeking to mitigate the potentially deleterious outcomes associated with water use and chemical application, by identifying the subpopulations most likely to irrigate, fertilize, and/or apply pesticides.","tags":["urban ecology","yard care","fertilizer","irrigation","pesticides","lawns","socio-economic status"],"title":"Residential household yard care practices along urban-exurban gradients in six climatically-diverse U.S. metropolitan areas","type":"publication"},{"authors":[""],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1554091200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1554091200,"objectID":"2eb4aab48d9b6aa7c3f6a2e95e2dafea","permalink":"/publication/trammell-c4plants-ecoapps/","publishdate":"2019-04-01T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/trammell-c4plants-ecoapps/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["urban ecology"],"title":"Climate and lawn management interact to control C4 plant distribution in residential lawns across seven US cities","type":"publication"},{"authors":[""],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1552363200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1552363200,"objectID":"06f1a3b84e5551fde3a9b9cd9e74bf6d","permalink":"/publication/padu-nonnative-ecosphere/","publishdate":"2019-03-12T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/padu-nonnative-ecosphere/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["urban ecology"],"title":"Contribution of non-native plants to the phylogenetic homogenization of U.S.yard floras","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"NSF Link An apparent, but untested result of changes to the urban landscape is the homogenization of cities, such that neighborhoods in very different parts of the country increasingly exhibit similar patterns in their road systems, residential lots, commercial sites, and aquatic areas; cities have now become more similar to each other than to the native ecosystems that they replaced. This research builds on the team\u0026rsquo;s prior NSF funded research on the ecological homogenization of the \u0026lsquo;American Residential Macrosystem (ARM)\u0026rsquo; and specifically investigates factors that contribute to stability and/or changes in the ARM. The aim is to determine how factors that effect change such as shifts in human demographics, desires for biodiversity and water conservation, regulations that govern water use and quality, and dispersal of organisms will interact with factors that contribute to stability such as social norms, property values, neighborhood and city covenants and laws, and commercial interests. We are determining ecological implications of alternative futures of the ARM for the assembly of ecological communities, ecosystem function, and responses to environmental change and disturbance at parcel (ecosystem), landscape (city), regional (Metropolitan Statistical Area) and continental scales. Five types of residential parcels as well as embedded semi-natural interstitial ecosystems are being studied, across six U.S. cities (Boston, Baltimore, Miami, Minneapolis-St. Paul, Phoenix, and Los Angeles). Education and outreach work focuses on K-12 teachers and students and on collaborative policy efforts with city, county, and state environmental managers.\nThis project investigates urbanization\u0026rsquo;s impact on the ecological homogenization of the American Residential Macrosystem (ARM) in terms of plant biodiversity, soil carbon and nitrogen cycle pools and processes, microclimate, hydrography, and land cover. This similarity of ecological characteristics is driven by complex and dynamic human actions at multiple scales (e.g., parcel, neighborhood, and region) that will shape the structure and function of the ARM over 50 to 100 year time frames, with potentially significant continental scale effects on ecological processes and environmental quality. This research addresses two core questions:\n What factors contribute to maintenance and change in the ARM?\nWhile this macrosystem is a relatively homogeneous mixture of grass lawns, shrubs, trees and impervious surfaces, there is a critical need to determine how drivers of change such as shifts in human population and ethnicity, increasing desires for biodiversity and water conservation, and regulations governing water use and quality will interact with stabilizing factors such as social norms, property values, neighborhood and city covenants and laws, and commercial interests. Researchers are testing the hypothesis that although dispersal from natural and interstitial areas, climate change, and changes in homeowner knowledge will promote ecological change; institutions, norms and values will function as counteracting, stabilizing forces on these ecological dynamics. This hypothesis is being tested by evaluating the factors that motivate change and stability at multiple scales. Results are being used to produce quantitative, data-based scenarios of future land-use patterns in the ARM.\n What are the ecological implications of alternative futures of this macrosystem for community assembly and ecosystem function at parcel (ecosystem), landscape (city), regional (Metropolitan Statistical Area), and continental scales?\nWe are testing the hypothesis that management promoting nutrient- and water-use efficient and wildlife-supporting plants as well as lower inputs of water and nutrients will give rise to greater regional biodiversity across trophic levels, higher nutrient retention, lower water use, and reduced runoff and losses of soil carbon and nitrogen from residential yards at the regional scale. Five types of residential parcels that vary in management goals and intensity and embedded semi-natural interstitial ecosystems will be studied in six U.S. cities across the U.S. (Boston, Baltimore, Miami, Minneapolis-St. Paul, Phoenix, and Los Angeles), to quantify influences on ecological dynamics. This information is being linked to land use scenarios to address the regional and continental-scale impacts of these effects. Three postdocs are mentored as co-investigators on this project. The research program includes interaction with municipal decision makers focused on sustainability and add a new \u0026lsquo;Panel of Experts\u0026rsquo; feature to the YardMap citizen science program developed at Cornell University.\n  ","date":1551243600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1551243600,"objectID":"8f66d660a9a2edc2d08e68cc30f701f7","permalink":"/project/internal-project/","publishdate":"2019-02-27T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/project/internal-project/","section":"project","summary":"A research project funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation program on “MacroSystems Biology: Research on Biological Systems at Regional to Continental Scales","tags":["Residential Yards","Macrosystem Biology","Ecological Forecasting"],"title":"Alternative ecological futures for the American Residential Macrosystem","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"NSF Link Urban, suburban and exurban environments are important ecosystems and their extent is increasing in the U.S. The conversion of wild or managed ecosystems to urban ecosystems is resulting in ecosystem homogenization across cities, where neighborhoods in very different parts of the country have similar patterns of roads, residential lots, commercial areas and aquatic features. We tested the hypothesis that this homogenization alters ecological structure and functions relevant to ecosystem carbon and nitrogen dynamics, with continental scale implications. The research provides a framework for understanding the impacts of urban land use change from local to continental scales. This project encompassed datasets ranging from household surveys to regional-scale remote sensing across six metropolitan statistical areas (MSA) that cover the major climatic regions of the US (Phoenix, AZ, Miami, FL, Baltimore, MD, Boston, MA, St. Paul, MN and Los Angeles, CA) to determine how household characteristics correlate with landscaping decisions, land management practices and ecological structure and functions at local, regional and continental scales. The results of this work transforms scientific understanding of an important and increasingly common ecosystem type (\u0026lsquo;suburbia\u0026rsquo;) and the consequences to carbon storage and nitrogen pollution at multiple scales. In addition, it advances our understanding of how humans perceive, value and manage their surroundings. The project leveraged an extensive, multi-scale program of education and outreach associated with ongoing LTER and/or ULTRA-EX projects.

Because they are ubiquitous, lawns are good systems in which to study the potential homogenizing effects of urban land use and management together with the continental-scale effects of climate on ecosystem structure and functioning. We hypothesized that similar homeowner preferences and management in residential areas across the United States would lead to low plant species diversity in lawns and relatively homogeneous vegetation across broad geographical regions. We also hypothesized that lawn plant species richness would increase with regional temperature and precipitation due to the presence of spontaneous, weedy vegetation, but would decrease with household income and fertilizer use. To test these predictions, we compared plant species composition and richness in residential lawns in seven U.S. metropolitan regions. We also compared species composition in lawns with understory vegetation in minimally-managed reference areas in each city. As expected, the composition of cultivated turfgrasses was more similar among lawns than among reference areas, but this pattern also held among spontaneous species. Plant species richness and diversity varied more among lawns than among reference areas, and more diverse lawns occurred in metropolitan areas with higher precipitation. Native forb diversity increased with precipitation and decreased with income, driving overall lawn diversity trends with these predictors as well. Our results showed that both management and regional climate shaped lawn species composition, but the overall homogeneity of species regardless of regional context strongly suggested that management was a more important driver.","tags":["plants","homogenization","Lawn","Residential yards","Species composition","Turfgrass"],"title":"Continental-scale homogenization of residential lawn plant communities","type":"publication"},{"authors":[""],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1498104000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1498104000,"objectID":"2f4a90171a8c47fc3415fdac02726ff4","permalink":"/publication/groffman-homogenization-nee/","publishdate":"2017-06-22T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/groffman-homogenization-nee/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["urban ecology"],"title":"Ecological homogenization of residential macrosystems","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"Click on the Slides button above to view the built-in slides feature.\n Slides can be added in a few ways:\n Create slides using Academic\u0026rsquo;s Slides feature and link using url_slides parameter in the front matter of the talk file Upload an existing slide deck to static/ and link using url_slides parameter in the front matter of the talk file Embed your slides (e.g. Google Slides) or presentation video on this page using shortcodes.

In this paper, we report findings of a cross-site survey of homeowners in six U.S. cities to 1) examine how residents subjectively value various ecosystem services, 2) explore distinctive dimensions of those values, and 3) test the urban homogenization hypothesis. This hypothesis posits that urbanization leads to similarities in the social-ecological dynamics across cities in diverse biomes. By extension, the thesis suggests that residents’ ecosystem service priorities for residential landscapes will be similar regardless of whether residents live in the humid East or the arid West, or the warm South or the cold North. Results underscored that cultural services were of utmost importance, particularly anthropocentric values including aesthetics, low-maintenance, and personal enjoyment. Using factor analyses, distinctive dimensions of residents’ values were found to partially align with the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment’s categories (provisioning, regulating, supporting, and cultural). Finally, residents’ ecosystem service priorities exhibited significant homogenization across regions. In particular, the traditional lawn aesthetic (neat, green, weed-free yards) was similarly important across residents of diverse U.S. cities. Only a few exceptions were found across different environmental and social contexts; for example, cooling effects were more important in the warm South, where residents also valued aesthetics more than those in the North, where low-maintenance yards were a greater priority.","tags":["Lawns","Residential landscapes","Land management","Human values","Ecosystem services","Urban sustainability"],"title":"Ecosystem services in managing residential landscapes: priorities, value dimensions, and cross-regional patterns","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Colin Polsky, J.

Urbanization, one of the principal drivers of these transformations, is commonly thought to be generating land changes that are increasingly similar. An implication of this multiscale homogenization hypothesis is that the ecosystem structure and function and human behaviors associated with urbanization should be more similar in certain kinds of urbanized locations across biogeophysical gradients than across urbanization gradients in places with similar biogeophysical characteristics. This paper introduces an analytical framework for testing this hypothesis, and applies the framework to the case of residential lawn care. This set of land management behaviors are often assumed—not demonstrated—to exhibit homogeneity. Multivariate analyses are conducted on telephone survey responses from a geographically stratified random sample of homeowners (n = 9,480), equally distributed across six US metropolitan areas. Two behaviors are examined: lawn fertilizing and irrigating. Limited support for strong homogenization is found at two scales (i.e., multi- and single-city; 2 of 36 cases), but significant support is found for homogenization at only one scale (22 cases) or at neither scale (12 cases). These results suggest that US lawn care behaviors are more differentiated in practice than in theory. Thus, even if the biophysical outcomes of urbanization are homogenizing, managing the associated sustainability implications may require a multiscale, differentiated approach because the underlying social practices appear relatively varied. The analytical approach introduced here should also be productive for other facets of urban-ecological homogenization.","tags":["sustainability science","land-change science","urban ecology","private land management"],"title":"Assessing the homogenization of urban land management with an application to US residential lawn care","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M.K.

However, the scope and consequences of surface water redistribution at broad spatial scales are not well understood. We hypothesized that urbanization would lead to convergent surface water abundance and distribution: in other words, cities will gain or lose water such that they become more similar to each other than are their surrounding natural landscapes. Using a database of more than 1 million water bodies and 1 million km of streams, we compared the surface water of 100 US cities with their surrounding undeveloped land. We evaluated differences in areal (A WB) and numeric densities (N WB) of water bodies (lakes, wetlands, and so on), the morphological characteristics of water bodies (size), and the density (D C) of surface flow channels (that is, streams and rivers). The variance of urban A WB, N WB, and D C across the 100 MSAs decreased, by 89, 25, and 71%, respectively, compared to undeveloped land. These data show that many cities are surface water poor relative to undeveloped land; however, in drier landscapes urbanization increases the occurrence of surface water. This convergence pattern strengthened with development intensity, such that high intensity urban development had an areal water body density 98% less than undeveloped lands. Urbanization appears to drive the convergence of hydrological features across the US, such that surface water distributions of cities are more similar to each other than to their surrounding landscapes.","tags":["surface water","urbanization","cities","convergence","urban streams","urban water bodies","hydrography","homogenization"],"title":"Convergent Surface Water Distributions in U.S. Cities","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Peter M Groffman, Jeannine Cavender-Bares, Neil D Bettez, J Morgan Grove, Sharon J Hall, James B Heffernan, Sarah E Hobbie, Kelli L Larson, Jennifer L Morse, Christopher Neill, Kristen Nelson, Jarlath O'Neil-Dunne, Laura Ogden, Diane E Pataki, Colin Polsky, Rinku Roy Chowdhury, Meredith K Steele"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1391230800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1391230800,"objectID":"0f1adf0bdca4067a4183192fcec21b59","permalink":"/publication/groffman-homogenization-fee/","publishdate":"2014-02-01T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/groffman-homogenization-fee/","section":"publication","summary":"A visually apparent but scientifically untested outcome of land‐use change is homogenization across urban areas, where neighborhoods in different parts of the country have similar patterns of roads, residential lots, commercial areas, and aquatic features.

Here, we show how multi‐scale, multi‐disciplinary datasets from six metropolitan areas that cover the major climatic regions of the US (Phoenix, AZ; Miami, FL; Baltimore, MD; Boston, MA; Minneapolis–St Paul, MN; and Los Angeles, CA) can be used to determine how household and neighborhood characteristics correlate with land‐management practices, land‐cover composition, and landscape structure and ecosystem functions at local, regional, and continental scales.","tags":["homogenization","urban ecology","private land management"],"title":"Ecological homogenization of urban USA","type":"publication"},{"authors":["GA Cushen","MS Nixon"],"categories":null,"content":"More detail can easily be written here using Markdown and $\\rm \\LaTeX$ math code.\n","date":1372651200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1372651200,"objectID":"6047b863bb02705c7ad39c5b1acf1855","permalink":"/examples/clothing-search/","publishdate":"2013-07-01T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/examples/clothing-search/","section":"examples","summary":"We present a mobile visual clothing search system whereby a smart phone user can either choose a social networking photo or take a new photo of a person wearing clothing of interest and search for similar clothing in a retail database. From the query image, the person is detected, clothing is segmented, and clothing features are extracted and quantized. The information is sent from the phone client to a server, where the feature vector of the query image is used to retrieve similar clothing products from online databases. The phone's GPS location is used to re-rank results by retail store location. State of the art work focuses primarily on the recognition of a diverse range of clothing offline and pays little attention to practical applications. Evaluated on a challenging dataset, the system is relatively fast and achieves promising results.","tags":[],"title":"Mobile visual clothing search","type":"examples"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"85dd4d131821dc3a7e7f844b48b8b7b8","permalink":"/test_map/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/test_map/","section":"","summary":" ","tags":null,"title":"","type":"page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Welcome to Slides Academic\nFeatures  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides  Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E  Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)  Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = \\;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\nFragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \nA fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears  Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view   Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links   night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links  Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/img/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}  Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }  Questions?
