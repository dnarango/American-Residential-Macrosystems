        <p>Urban,  suburban and exurban ecosystems are important and increasing in the U.S.&nbsp; An apparent, but functionally untested result  of urban land use change is homogenization across cities, where neighborhoods  in very different parts of the country have similar patterns of roads,  residential lots, commercial areas and aquatic features.&nbsp; We hypothesize that this homogenization also  involves ecological structure and functions relevant to ecosystem carbon and  nitrogen dynamics, with continental scale implications.&nbsp; Further, we suggest that understanding urban  homogenization will provide the basis for understanding the impacts of urban  land use change from local to continental scales.&nbsp; We will use datasets ranging from household  surveys to regional-scale remote sensing across six metropolitan statistical  areas (MSA) that cover the major climatic regions of the US (Phoenix, AZ,  Miami, FL, Baltimore, MD, Boston, MA, St. Paul, MN and Los Angeles, CA) to  determine how household characteristics correlate with landscaping decisions,  land management practices and ecological structure and functions at local,  regional and continental scales.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>This  research has the potential to transform both understanding of an important and  increasingly common ecosystem type (“suburbia”) and the capacity to scale the  effects of local land use change to regional and continental extents.&nbsp; We will determine how urban land use change  has affected carbon storage and nitrogen pollution at multiple scales, and  further understanding of how humans perceive, value and manage their  surroundings.</p>
        <h3>Introduction – urbanization and  homogenization</h3>
        <p>Urban  land use change has been identified as one of the major components of  environmental change because of its effects on fluxes of water, carbon and  nutrients across large areas of the globe (Foley et al. 2005,  Grimm et al. 2008).&nbsp; Between 1982 and 1997 the amount of urbanized land in the  United States increased by almost 50% (Fulton et al. 2001), extending over 1.4 million sq. km. and housing over  80% of the U.S. population (Brown et al. 2005). Most of this growth is suburban and exurban.&nbsp; In the 2000 census, suburban growth surpassed  growth in cities regardless of city-specific population dynamics and economic  trajectories (Duany et al. 2000,  Katz et al. 2003).&nbsp; </p>
        <p>Urban,  suburban and exurban ecosystems present a unique and difficult challenge to  environmental scientists and managers.&nbsp;  These highly managed systems have large impacts on air and water quality  and human well being, but the diversity of natural and human drivers, and high  heterogeneity at small scales (10 – 100 m) complicate their analysis and  management (Grimm et al. 2008,  Pickett et al. 2010).&nbsp; As interest in understanding  the continental-scale impacts of environmental change increases (Keller et al. 2008), there is a critical need to develop conceptual and  practical tools to address the complex controls and heterogeneity of  increasingly important urban, suburban and exurban ecosystems.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>An  apparent, but functionally untested result of contemporary U.S. urban land use  change is ecological homogenization across cities, wherein human dominance and leading  land-management practices render urban/suburban systems more similar to each  other than to adjacent &nbsp;native ecosystems  (Pouyat et al. 2007,  Pickett et al. 2010).&nbsp; Such homogenization would be manifest in biophysical  structure, where neighborhoods across biophysically different regions have  similar patterns of roads, residential lots, commercial areas and aquatic  features.&nbsp; This homogenization would result  in ecological transformation, with replacement of natural vegetation  assemblages by turfgrass yards, popular plant species, and impervious surfaces (Turner et al. 1990,  Byrne 2007, Cadenasso et al. 2007, Walker et al. 2009). &nbsp;</p>
